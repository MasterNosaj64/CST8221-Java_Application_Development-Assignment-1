#Java Application Development - Assignment 1 - CST8221 - Algonquin College - Computer Engineering - Computing Science

-  Create a Swing GUI for a Calculator Application mimicking a provided screen capture.
-  Ensure GUI includes specific features: mode/error display, backspace button, keypad buttons with specified colors and symbols, arithmetic operator buttons, clear and equal buttons, two non-editable display text fields, and a mode panel with a checkbox and radio buttons.
-  Use BorderLayout and GridLayout for arranging components.
-  GUI must maintain appearance and behavior upon resizing.
-  Implement classes: CalculatorViewController for GUI operations, Controller for event handling, and Calculator for application launch.
-  Develop a splash screen with an image, name, and student number.
-  Add a CalculatorModel class for calculations in the calculator package.
-  Complete event handling in the Controller class(es).
-  Implement set methods for operands, arithmetic operations, operational mode, and floating-point precision in CalculatorModel.
-  Include a get method for formatted result and set/get methods for error state in CalculatorModel.
-  Use a private calculate method in CalculatorModel for result computation.
-  Ensure the Controller class(es) handle all GUI action events without performing calculations.
-  Follow specific test checkpoints to verify calculator functionality, including mode switching, arithmetic operations, and error handling.
-  Bonus tasks include adding a progress bar to the splash screen, enhancing mode switching logic, and implementing keyboard input handling.
